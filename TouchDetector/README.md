<h1>Raspberry Pi Touch Detector Project!</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a touch detector project built on Raspberry Pi that detects touch when we pressed the sensor and released it. This also makes a sound through a buzzer when the touch sensor is pressed. This is assuming you have a working interface for your raspberry pi. This specific tutorial mounts the Raspberry Pi and uses Thonny IDE to run the code.</p>

<h2>Materials Needed</h2>

1 Raspberry Pi</br>
1 Breadboard </br>
1 Touch module </br>
1 Buzzer </br>
5 Male-to-Male cables (any color) <br>

<p>Note: the color of the cables do not matter, they just make things easier!</p>
 
<h4>Hardware Connection Setup</h4>

1.	Mount the Raspberry Pi GPIO extension board in the breadboard</br>
2.	Connect the touch module to the breadboard with the Raspberry Pi using the 3 Male-to-Male.</br>
3.	Here I connected the male to male wire with the wires comes with touch module</br>

 <h3>Software Instructions</h3>
1.	Open Thonny IDE and change to the Raspberry Pi (python 3.7.3) interpreter on the bottom right hand corner.</br>
2.	Click Plus sign and copy paste the code (from flameDetector.py) and save it or 
Download the file from GitHub and save it.</br>
3.	Modify the email part as needed( for example, you can change the email and password to email you have (Line 10 and Line 11) and email address in Line 41.</br>
4.	Run the program. If all goes well, when you run the program everything should work fine.</br>
